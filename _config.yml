# Site settings
# 
# Since our theme is very homebrew, we don't really use all of the traditional
# jekyll settings like title, they're just hardcoded in various places.  But
# this has some options written by jekyll, and some global routing options.
gems:
  - jekyll-redirect-from

markdown: kramdown
permalink: pretty

# We use collections to both do routing and to generate the navbar and some
# other metadata.  Properties:
#  * output, permalink: as specified by jekyll
#  * title: the title to use as the default or suffix for pages, and as the
#    navbar alt-text
#  * nav: true to show the collection in the navbar, in which case it should
#    have images in images/content-pages/navbar-links/<type>/<name>.gif for
#    each type in "normal" (the usual gray), "current" (blue if we are in that
#    section of the site), and "hover" (red on hover)
#  * seq: set to a positive value (used as ordering) to show in the navbar
#  * sep: true to show a sep after this item in the nav
#  * br: true to put a line break after this item in the nav
#  * url: if specified, link to this instead of our own pages.  In this case,
#    output should likely be set to false.
# Each page in the collection goes in the directory _<collection name> and
# should have the following properties in the front matter:
#  * layout: as specified by jekyll, likely "default"
#  * title: as suggested by jekyll, also used in the navbar
#  * permalink: as specified by jekyll; due to jekyll limitations, the
#    index.html page for each collection MUST specify its permalink, including
#    a trailing slash
#  * redirect_from, redirect_to: as specified by jekyll-redirect-from
#  * seq: set to a positive value (used as ordering) to show in the sub-navbar
# Pages not in any section should go in the "misc" collection, and should
# likely specify a permalink.
