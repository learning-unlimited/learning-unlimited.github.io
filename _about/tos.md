PII, as described in US privacy and information security law, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Our privacy policy describes how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information submitted to our website.

We will never share information that could be used to identify a particular person (including their email address, mailing address, or phone number) without their consent. We will never sell or rent any PII.

No raw passwords are stored on our servers; all passwords are encrypted.

## Do we use cookies?

Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.

## California Online Privacy Protection Act

CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the world that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at: [here](http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf)

According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following: Users can visit our site anonymously. Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website. Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above. You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page. You can change your personal information by emailing us or by logging in to your account.

We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place. It's also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking; Google Analytics is used with marketing features deactivated on our site.

## COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)

When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which specifies what operators of commercial websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.

We do not specifically direct our marketing to children under the age of 13 years old; i.e. students in 6th grade and below.

## Fair Information Practices

The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.

In order to be in compliance with Fair Information Practices, should a data breach occur, we will notify you via email and via in-site notification within 7 business days of our knowledge of a data breach that may compromise your information.

We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle, which states that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
