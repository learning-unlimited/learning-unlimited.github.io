<p>The leaders of Learning Unlimited have all been key members of local programs in the past, while in college or graduate school.  They are:</p>

<h2>Our Board of Directors</h2>


<div class="biobox">
  <p><b>Zoe Lee, <i>Chair</i></b><br>
      <div class="imagebox floatright"><img src="/media/images/biopics/zoe.jpg" width="200" height="250" alt="Zoe L."></div>

Zoe found her passion in education as a tutor of a Philosophy class and then as a teacher at UCLA's 2018 Splash. Since then she has taught and directed numerous Splash programs as well as accredited university courses; in doing so, she strived to learn and incorporate evidence-based pedagogy. Now as part of the Board, she aims to utilize those experiences to create resources that will help teachers teach better--while having fun!--as well as resources that will support the growth of new Splash chapters. Zoe is currently pursuing her graduate studies in cognitive science at UCLA.

  <p><b>Julia Wang</b><br>

Julia discovered Splash at Yale's admitted students' weekend, and she has never looked back. Julia is an undergraduate student at Yale University studying Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology and Education Studies. When she isn't studying or completing Splash tasks, you can probably find her listening to Taylor Swift, eating fries, or making a spreadsheet (all at the same time?). Her favorite Splash memory is singing 2010s-throwback songs in her pajamas with the team after Sprout at Yale 2020. After serving as a co-director, mentor, co-president, and teacher, Julia is excited to join the LU Board!  <div class="clear"></div>

  <p><b>Our Volunteers</b><br>
The Learning Unlimited volunteers are composed of former program leaders working alongside others who never had a chance to run a Splash. Some are still in college, while some have long graduated, but they all help to make our programs a reality. They bring diverse talents, from business
and legal advice to web programming to graphic design, and together form the backbone of our organization.  We invite anyone with interest to join us in volunteering by emailing us at <a href="mailto:info@learningu.org">info@learningu.org</a> with a brief description of what excites you about Splash and how you are interested in helping.</p>
