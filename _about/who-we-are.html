  <p><b>Ben Kraft</b><br>
Ben studied math with a side of physics, computer science, and political science at MIT.  In his "spare" time, he co-chaired MIT ESP, represented MIT ESP on the LU Chapter Board, and directed several programs.  Now a software engineer at Khan Academy, he still mentors several LU programs, works on the website used by LU chapters, and teaches math, physics, and gerrymandering at various Splash programs.  When he's not busy learning, teaching, or writing education-related software, he enjoys hiking, folding origami, and making smoothies.

  <p><b>Our Volunteers</b><br>
The Learning Unlimited volunteers are composed of former program leaders working alongside others who never had a chance to run a Splash. Some are still in college, while some have long graduated, but they all help to make our programs a reality. They bring diverse talents, from business
and legal advice to web programming to graphic design, and together form the backbone of our organization.  We invite anyone with interest to join us in volunteering; <a href = "../help/">find out more</a>.</p>
