<h1>Who We Are</h1>

<p>Learning Unlimited consists of committees designed to support and expand Splash programs across the nation.
  Former program leaders work alongside others who never had a chance to run a Splash. Some are still in college, while some have long graduated, but they all help to make our programs a reality. They bring diverse talents, from business
and legal advice to web programming to graphic design, and together form the backbone of our organization.  We invite anyone with interest to join! Reach out to us at <a href="mailto:info@learningu.org">info@learningu.org</a> with a brief description of what excites you about Splash and how you are interested in helping.</p>
