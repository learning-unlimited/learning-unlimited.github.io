  <p><b>Lauren MacLachlan </b><br>
As a teenager in New Jersey, Lauren had the fortune of first gaining exposure to two lifelong passions in the same day – neuroscience and Splash. While pursuing a neuroscience degree at Northeastern University, Lauren grew a deep love for Splash and Learning Unlimited. Lauren has worked for three years performing research as a sleep technician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. She can often be found teaching Splash classes on circadian rhythms, psychopharmacology, and even game shows!

      <div class="imagebox floatright"><img src="/media/images/biopics/zoe.jpeg" width="200" height="200" alt="Ben H."></div>

Zoe found her passion in education as a tutor of a Philosophy class and then as a teacher at UCLA's 2018 Splash. Since then she has taught and directed numerous Splash programs as well as accredited university courses; in doing so, she strived to learn and incorporate evidence-based pedagogy. Now as part of the Board, she aims to utilize those experiences to create resources that will help teachers teach better--while having fun!--as well as resources that will support the growth of new Splash chapters. Zoe is currently pursuing her graduate studies in cognitive science at UCLA.

  <p><b>Our Volunteers</b><br>
The Learning Unlimited volunteers are composed of former program leaders working alongside others who never had a chance to run a Splash. Some are still in college, while some have long graduated, but they all help to make our programs a reality. They bring diverse talents, from business
and legal advice to web programming to graphic design, and together form the backbone of our organization.  We invite anyone with interest to join us in volunteering by emailing us at <a href="mailto:info@learningu.org">info@learningu.org</a> with a brief description of what excites you about Splash and how you are interested in helping.</p>
